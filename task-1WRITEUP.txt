Task-1

1 Ans:
Http 1.1 requests and responses in plain text format
Http 2 uses a binary frame layer for the binary format encapsulation of messages.
Conversion of messages into binary data allows the data delivery in various ways in Http 2
unlike in Http 1.1
Splitting up the data into binary format makes the data transfer flexible.
Http 1.1 relies on the transport layer to control the buffer flow for data transmission and
reception.
Http 2 allows the client and server to implement their independent flow controls.
Http 2 allows compression of http messages between client and server which is not the case in
Http 1.1.

2 Ans:
Year HTTP Version
1996 1.0
1997 1.1
2015 2.0

3 Ans:
1)Node js allows to use a single language both on the server and client side unlike Browser js.
2)Browser js provides objects like document window and cookies or DOM interaction, which is
not present in Node js.
3)In Node js you control the environment, the version on which you want to run the application
on, which isn't possible in Browser js. You cannot know which platform the user will run the
application on.
4)Node js uses modules for everything, while Browser js doesn't mandate the modules on client
side.
5) Node js processes request objects and Browser js processes response objects.
4 Ans:
The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
The server sends back a HTTP response
The browser begins rendering the HTML
The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript)
and repeats steps 3-5.
Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
