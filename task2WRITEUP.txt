Task 2-part 1

Answer 1:
COPY BY VALUE
The value is actually copied; there are two distinct, independent copies.
A distinct copy of the value is passed to the function; changes to it have no effect outside the
function.
Two distinct values are compared (often byte by byte) to see if they are the same value.
COPY BY REFERENCE
Only a reference to the value is copied. If the value is modified through the new reference, that
change is also visible through the original reference.
A reference to the value is passed to the function. If the function modifies the value through the
passed reference, the modification is visible outside the function. docstore.
Two references are compared to see if they refer to the same value. Two references to distinct
values are not equal, even if the two values consist of the same bytes.

Answer 2:
1.Use the spread (...) syntax.
2.Use the Object.assign() method.
3.Use the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods.
const person = {
firstName: 'John',
lastName: 'Doe'
};
// using spread ...
let p1 = {
...person
};
// using Object.assign() method
let p2 = Object.assign({}, person);
// using JSON
let p3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
